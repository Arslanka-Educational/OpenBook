# openBook

This Kotlin based [Spring Boot](https://spring.io/projects/spring-boot) application has been generated using the [OpenAPI Generator](https://github.com/OpenAPITools/openapi-generator).

## Getting Started

This document assumes you have either maven or gradle available, either via the wrapper or otherwise. This does not come with a gradle / maven wrapper checked in.

To build the project using gradle, run:
```bash
gradle build && java -jar build/libs/core-openBook-1.0.0.jar
```

If all builds successfully, the server should run on [http://localhost:8080/](http://localhost:8080/)
